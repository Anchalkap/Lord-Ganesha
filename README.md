# Lord-Ganesha

This Python code uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a pattern and ends with writing "Happy Ganesh Chaturthi" on the screen. The code sets up the turtle's speed, pen size, and colors for both the background and the pen. It defines a function myposition() to move the turtle to a specific location without drawing.
